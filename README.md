# MergeAtlasMeta
Unity's Editor extension for merge atlas meta. Very useful in collaborating work with other artists on the same project

MAJOR NOTE: IT DOESN'T WORK IN UNITY 2018.3.11f1 (UNITY BLOCKED METAFILES BY EDITOR AND YOU CAN NOT WRITE INTO IT)

It works normally in unity 2018.3.3f1.

You can merge metadata from two atlases in one of them. In meta stored: sprite regions, sizes, pivot points, bones, meshes and bone weights information.

Also, it can fix all links in prefabs and scenes. Fix missed sprites in prefabs or change from one atlas to another.
